    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  container-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run AccuKnox Container Scanner
        uses: accuknox/container-scan-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          soft_fail: false          # set false to fail workflow if vulnerabilities are found
          accuknox_endpoint: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT }}
          accuknox_label: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_LABEL }}
          accuknox_token: ${{ secrets.ACCUKNOX_TOKEN }}
          image: "your-image-name"
          tag: "latest"             # optional

## 🔍 How It Works

1️⃣ **Container Image is Scanned**
AccuKnox Container Vulnerability Scanner analyzes the specified image for CVEs and misconfigurations.

2️⃣ **Scan Report Generated**
A JSON scan report is produced with detailed findings.

3️⃣ **Upload to AccuKnox Console**
The report is securely sent to your tenant's dashboard for centralized review and tracking.

4️⃣ **Severity Filtering (Optional)**
If `severity` is defined, the workflow will block if matching vulnerabilities are found.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Best Practices

❌ **Pipeline Blocked by Vulnerabilities?**

* Adjust the `severity` input to allow less critical findings.
* Review scan reports in the AccuKnox Console to triage issues.

🔑 **Authentication Errors?**

* Verify your `token` and `tenant_id` are correctly stored in GitHub Secrets.
* Regenerate credentials in AccuKnox Console if needed.

🧪 **Best Practices**

* Scan every push and release candidate.
* Monitor trends via AccuKnox Console for proactive risk management.
